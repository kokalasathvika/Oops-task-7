📌 Overview

This assignment demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming concepts using Java.
Each problem is implemented using a class with attributes (data members) and methods (functions).

The programs simulate real-world systems like smart home devices, employee records, mobile contacts, retail billing, streaming platforms, and delivery systems.

🧠 OOPS Concepts Used

Class and Object

Data Members

Methods

Encapsulation (basic level)

Object creation

Method calling
